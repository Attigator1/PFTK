Tool: Volatility
Description:  This tool is majorly used for forensics. It has a memory and network anaylsis functionality. It is able to give important details on the memory image file and provide detailed reports. There are also plugins that are able to filter out possible malware files. Volatility is python based.
Review: This tool is extremely helpful. Once you have a suspect memory file, you are able to gain much information about the time of the memory image. It does only give information about the time of the image but it does give information about systems, processes, files and network connections.
Usage: Once you have the memory file and the plugins, there is much functionality.  In order to examine the file, you need to find the profile that matches the memory type. To find that information, run the command: {python vol.py -f <memory file> imageinfo} . If you want to output results of commands to a file, the command is {python vol.py -f <memory file> --profile=<profile> <volatility command> > <file>} . The general format for the commands and plugins are as follows: {python vol.py -f <memory file> --profile=<profile> <function>} . If you want to scan or generate the list of processes, you would use the psscan (for scanning), pslist (to generate list) or pstree (to generate process tree). The functions netscan, connscan and sockscan can give you network connection info. For Malware scan, you would use malfind --dump-dir <directory of dump location>. With the dump, you can use VirusTotal to check each file.
